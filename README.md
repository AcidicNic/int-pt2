(I'm skipping the trees, stacks/queues, and linked list questions because I've implemented all of these in another repo already.)

1. Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)

2. Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams

3. Find the shortest palindrome in a String

4. Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int

5. Implement squareroot function
